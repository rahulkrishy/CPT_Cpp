/*
<bits/stdc++.h> in C++
It is a header file that includes every standard library.

Advantages of bits/stdc++.h:
  -Reduces the need to write and remember all necessary header files.
  -Saves time in contests, especially when rank is time-sensitive.
  -Simplifies the use of STL functions in GNU C++.

Disadvantages of using bits/stdc++.h:
  -It's a non-standard GNU C++ header.
  -It may not work with other compilers, such as MSVC.
  -It includes many unnecessary files, increasing compilation time.
